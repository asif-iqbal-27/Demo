Overview of software metrics 
Software metrics are quantitative measures used to assess various aspects of software 
development, maintenance, and quality. These metrics provide insights into the efficiency, 
effectiveness, and overall health of the software development process and the resulting software 
product. Software metrics are vital for making informed decisions, improving processes, and 
enhancing software quality. Here's an overview of some common categories of software metrics:

Chunk 1_1 (Page 1):
Size Metrics 
Lines of Code (LOC): Measures the total number of lines of code in a software program. It's a 
simple way to estimate the size and complexity of a project. 
Function Points (FP): Measures software size based on its functionality, considering inputs, 
outputs, inquiries, internal files, and external interfaces. 
Effort and Cost Metrics: 
Person-Month (PM): Represents the amount of effort required to complete a project in terms of 
the number of team members working for a month.

Chunk 1_2 (Page 1):
the number of team members working for a month. 
Cost Per Defect (CPD): Calculates the cost associated with finding, fixing, and verifying defects 
in the software. 
Time Metrics: 
Lead Time: The time taken to complete a task from the moment it's initiated. 
Cycle Time: The time taken to complete a task from the moment work begins until it's finished. 
Productivity Metrics: 
Defect Density: Measures the number of defects in the software per unit of size (e.g., defects per

Chunk 1_3 (Page 1):
KLOC (thousands of lines of code)). 
Lines of Code per Developer Day: Indicates the productivity of developers in terms of lines of 
code produced per day.

development lifecycle and within an organization as a whole: 
Objective Decision-Making: Metrics provide quantifiable data that supports informed decision-
making. Project managers and stakeholders can make decisions based on facts rather than 
subjective judgments. 
Process Improvement: Metrics help identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and areas for 
improvement in the software development process. By analyzing these metrics, teams can 
streamline processes and enhance productivity.

Chunk 2_3 (Page 2):
streamline processes and enhance productivity.

issues. This enables teams to address problems before they escalate, reducing the cost and effort 
required for fixes. 
Quality Assurance: Quality metrics, such as defect removal efficiency and failure rate, offer 
insights into the quality of the software. This information guides teams in maintaining or 
improving software quality.

Resource Allocation: Metrics like effort estimation and productivity metrics help allocate 
resources effectively. Teams can identify areas where additional resources are needed or where 
resources are being underutilized.

performance. This allows organizations to recognize and reward high-performing teams and 
individuals.

Chapter-1: Measurement- What is it and why do it? 
 
Software Measurement 
Measurement is a cornerstone of software engineering, providing the means to systematically 
understand, control, and enhance software development and maintenance processes. Unlike 
traditional engineering disciplines, software engineering has historically faced challenges in 
embracing rigorous measurement practices, which has limited the field's ability to predict

Chunk 4_1 (Page 4):
outcomes, improve quality, and reduce costs effectively. 
Software measurement is the process of quantifying various attributes, characteristics, and 
properties of software products, processes, and resources using standardized methods and metrics. 
The goal of software measurement is to obtain objective, quantitative data that can be analyzed 
and used to make informed decisions, improve processes, and assess the quality and progress of 
software-related activities.

Chunk 4_2 (Page 4):
software-related activities. 
Software measurement is an essential components of good software engineering. Many of the best 
developers measure characteristics of their software to get some sense whether the requirements 
are consistent and complete, whether the design is of high quality, and whether the code is ready 
to be released. Effective project managers measure attributes of processes and products to be able

Chunk 4_3 (Page 4):
to tell when software will be ready for delivery and whether a budget will be exceeded. 
Organizations use process evaluation measurements to select suppliers. Informed customers 
measure the aspects of the final product to determine if it meets the requirements and is of 
sufficient quality. Also, maintainers must be able to assess the current product to see what should 
be upgraded and improved. Objectives for software Measurement Even when a project is not in

Chunk 4_4 (Page 4):
trouble, measurement is not only useful but also necessary. After all, how can you tell if your 
project is healthy if you have no measures of its health? So, measurement is needed at least for 
assessing the status of your projects, products, processes and resources. The measurement 
objectives must be specific, tied to what the managers, developers, and users need to know. 
Managers' viewpoint: 
➢ What does each process cost? 
➢ How productive is the staff?
